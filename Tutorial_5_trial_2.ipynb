        "\n",
        "Let's focus on a rate code. When input data is passed to the network, we want the correct neuron class to emit the most spikes over the course of the simulation run. This then corresponds to the highest average firing frequency. One way to achieve this is to increase the membrane potential of the correct class to $U>U_{\\rm thr}$, and that of incorrect classes to $U<U_{\\rm thr}$. Applying the target to $U$ serves as a proxy for modulating spiking behavior from $S$.\n",

        "The practical effect is that the membrane potential of the correct class is encouraged to increase while those of incorrect classes are reduced. In effect, this means the correct class is encouraged to fire at all time steps, while incorrect classes are suppressed at all steps. This may not be the most efficient implementation of an SNN, but it is among the simplest.\n",
        "\n",
